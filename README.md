Static site
============

This is the static website of bitbay.market. It also has an archive of the old forums which are no longer being hosted.
This site also has the staking calculator and web wallet code. All of the code here is front end so it doesn't rely
on any servers and any user who uses this can verify site security.


Development
----------
This was developed by various members of BitBay community, it's an open source website with very secure front end.
Site rip was done by software so this will eventually need to be cleaned up.
