    <title>&quot;Solved&quot; feature for topics</title>
    <link>..../forum-archive/t/solved-feature-for-topics/1208</link>
    <description>Just wanted to throw it out there. Is there a way to mark topics as solved? Would be nice especially for the support section. So much easier to look for a problem you&#39;re experiencing and see if it&#39;s already been solved elsewhere.</description>

Great idea<br>
The easy solution was and I already did create tag <strong>resolved</strong> so moderators at least can tag issues as resolved</p>
<p>So far there is only 1 request that we were not able to resolve for luck of response from user<br>
so I marked all support requests as resolved.</p>
<p>One can go to <a href="..../forum-archive/tags">tags</a> from their profile menu (next to the avatar) and choose “resolved”  or even use it in search like this <a href="..../forum-archive/search?q=tag%3Aresolved">tag:resolved</a></p>
<p>If a need comes for anything more sophisticated than this will consider it.</p>
