    <title>Effective staking rate</title>
    <link>..../forum-archive/t/effective-staking-rate/981</link>
    <description>Here is a quick spreadsheet I made regarding the approximate effective stake weight based on the number of BAY being staked on the network. So at 50% of the total supply staking the effective stake rate for your coins is 2% &quot;APR&quot;. These numbers are based off the available specs for BAY. If I&#39;m not mistaken I do believe that the minimum 1% stake is based off of the current supply at the time, ie currently 1,009,138,145 so the actual yearly stake amount would be 10,091,381 and growing.
