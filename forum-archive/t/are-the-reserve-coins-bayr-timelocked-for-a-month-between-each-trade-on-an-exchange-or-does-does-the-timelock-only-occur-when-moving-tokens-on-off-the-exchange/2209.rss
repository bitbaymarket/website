    <title>Are the reserve coins (BAYR) timelocked for a month between each trade on an exchange? Or does does the timelock only occur when moving tokens on/off the exchange?</title>

    <description>The reserve coins (BAYR) **are not timelocked between trades on centralized exchanges**. This is becuause the majority of centralized exchanges do not trade coins on  the actual blockchain, as it slows things down. Instead, they use an in-house IOU accounting system.

Once the reserve coins are no longer frozen, they can be traded freely at any time.However once a user transfers possession &#39;on-chain&#39; then the coins become timelocked again.</description>
