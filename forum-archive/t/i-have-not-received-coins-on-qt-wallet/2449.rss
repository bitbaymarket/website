    <title>I have not received coins on QT Wallet</title>
    <link>..../forum-archive/t/i-have-not-received-coins-on-qt-wallet/2449</link>
    <description>My system has the following specifications 

QT Wallet, Client Wallet (and version) or Web wallet: QT Wallet
Operating System and version: Windows 7
If web wallet browser name and version:
If desktop wallet (Qt or Client) block # of your client and # of connections: 

The problem I am having is  that I transferred 127 BAY coins from the LATOKEN exchange to my QT Wallet. The transaction was confirmed, but the coins never arrived. What should I do?</description>

              <p>I just checked the web wallet link instead of the QT and the sent balance is there. It say’s frozen for the balance sent.  The QT wallet (same address) doesn’t say anything. And I have used the -rescan option too.</p>
<p>So now my question is how do I sell my BAY without having to wait for the tiny fraction that move out of reserve every so often. How would I sell everything at once in the BAY format?</p>
<p>For someone coming into this project it is quite frustrating given the wait times to do anything with the coins.</p>

              <p>Just talked to LAToken. They said that it is most likely being held for 30 days in the BAYR format. Which I thought was just on their end and not something that was in place on BitBay’s QT wallet side.<br>
Is this true? <a class="mention" href="/u/sh_rn">@sh_rn</a></p>

              <p>Hi. Please speak to LAToken support and send them the tx ID. If a withdrawal from an exchange hasn’t reached your wallet then obviously you need to speak to the exchange about it.</p>
<p>Check your tx ID on chainz, check if you sent BAY L or BAYR and the contact LAToken.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
