    <title>What determines the amount of BAY received for stake rewards?</title>
    <link>../../../forum-archive/t/what-determines-the-amount-of-bay-received-for-stake-rewards/2226</link>
    <description>The amount received as a stake reward is dependent upon the status of liquidity for the input that is staked.

* If the staking input is **Liquid or &quot;Spendable&quot;**,  then it will receive a **5 coin reward**.

* If the staking input is **Reserve**,  then it will receive a **10 coin reward**.

* If the staking input is **Voluntarily Frozen Reserve**,  then it will receive a **20 coin reward**.

* If the staking input is **Voluntarily Frozen Liquid**,  then it will receive a **40 coin reward**.

Keep in mind, the Dynamic Peg index is frequently changing the total coin supply&#39;s ratio of Liquid to Reserve

If the Peg index (shown above) is **between 50 and 100**, you will have a **higher ratio of Liquid (Spendable)** coins, and therefore have a higher chance of earning **5 BAY** rewards.

If the Peg index meter (shown above) is **between 0 and 50**, you will have a **higher ratio of Reserve** coins, and therefore have a higher chance of earning **10 BAY** rewards.

***Note:
The stake rewards that are earned from voluntarily frozen inputs will be received as frozen, pro-rated to match the timelock of it&#39;s staked input. 

For example: 
1. Bob voluntarily freezes 100,000 Liquid BAY _(spendable)_ as one single input.
2. The date of voluntary freezing is on **January 1**, and the input will remain frozen until **May 1**. (4 months)
3. On **March 1**, Bob&#39;s 100,000 frozen BAY input earns a 40 BAY stake reward.
4. This 40 BAY stake reward will also remain frozen (along with Bob&#39;s 100,000 frozen BAY input) until **May 1**. 


**_If Bob checks the &quot;Reward to Address&quot;_** option in the Staking tab of the QT Wallet, and sends his reward to a separate address, the 40 BAY will not be frozen. Instead, it will be a mix of liquid (_spendable_) and reserve, depending on what the current peg index is at the time of receiving it.
