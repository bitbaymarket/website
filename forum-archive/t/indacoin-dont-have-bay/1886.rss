    <description>Hi,

In your latest tweet you mentioned that we could buy Bay from your partner Indacoin. Unfortunately, when i went to their website and checked there was no Bay in their list. I even asked their support if they have Bay but they said they don&#39;t. Also, i went to https://indacoin.com/en_GB/affiliate and clicked on your logo but it directed me to https://bitbay.net/en instead. Anyway i just thought you should know.</description>

              <p>Hi Bitaida,</p>
<p>Apologies for the late reply!<br>
Right now you can purchase BAY from these two places:</p>
<p><a href="https://novaexchange.com/">https://novaexchange.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://gaiavault.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://gaiavault.org/</a></p>
<p>Gaiavault also has a fiat gateway, where you can buy/sell direct with a bank account.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
