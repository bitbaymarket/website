        <p>Hi! Completely new here and I just found the project while trying to figure out how to do something.</p>
<p>Stellar is another crypto that has developed a <a href="https://github.com/stellar/horizon" rel="nofollow noopener">server API called Horizon</a> that anyone can host and allows people to communicate with the blockchain through web requests. This is very useful, since then you don’t need to build the market yourself, but anyone can create their own SPA market application by using the API.</p>
<p>Here is what I want to do: I want to create an online market to support my local community, people in the community decide which institutions/organizations they want to fund, and everyone agrees to pay a % of every purchase they make, or every profits they make, to the institutions they agreed to support.</p>
<p>Everyone on the community and the institutions should have a public address, and in a companion platform (for organization and democratic discussions) they can hold each other accountable to how much they contribute.</p>
<p>If the market is accessible through an API in the same way that Stellar offers Horizon, anyone can create their own niche market without the need of a server, in the same way one could create a Shopify store.</p>
<p>What I want to do is create a community-approved market where people participating agree that every time they buy something or they receive profits, a certain voluntary tax is paid and sent to the institutions that the community is funding.</p>
