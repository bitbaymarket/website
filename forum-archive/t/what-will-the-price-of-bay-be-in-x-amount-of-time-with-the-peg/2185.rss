    <description>**What will the price of BAY be in X amount of time with the peg?**

With BitBay’s Dynamic Peg, there is no fixed price, so it’s impossible to say what it will be in the future. The beauty of this system is that the price has room to adapt with demand and volume of the participants, at a healthy rate.

This price-flexibility truly separates it from other vulnerable &quot;fixed price&quot;, “hard pegs”, or “asset-backed pegs”, all which attempt to match the value of traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and assets — all of which experience varying levels of demand.

In the end, the price of BAY is purely dependent on the consensus of stakers and trading volume, both which are constantly changing.
