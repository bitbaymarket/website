              <p>As I understand it, Upbit intends to add Bay/KRW pair in addition to the BAY/BTC pair they already have. I have not spoken to them myself though, so please do not take this answer as a confirmation that it is certain to happen.<br>
We have also gotten invites from several other Korean exchanges to get listed. A main problem is that exchanges often ask a listing fee that is not proportional to the volume they offer. But we will keep talking to exchanges, and maybe it is possible to find a solution in the future.</p>
