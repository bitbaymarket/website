    <description>My system has the following specifications 

QT Wallet 3.0.2.0
Operating System and version: Windows 10

Hello,
I was synchronising the blockchain since  a few days. My computer was down, so I opened it again. 
Now when I launch the QT Wallet, it starts by loading the index block, then I have the message &quot;Error Loading Block Database&quot;.

Anything I can do ?</description>
