    <title>I didn&#39;t receive any coins in my wallet</title>
    <link>../../../forum-archive/t/i-didnt-receive-any-coins-in-my-wallet/2354</link>
    <description>Hello,

I downloaded the bitbay qt wallet in the beginning of the year and transferred some BAY to the receiving address that is shown. I was in a hurry, because the exchange, where i bought the coins, said i had to move those, otherwise they would get lost. So i didn&#39;t waste time and sent the coins to the qt wallet, while the blockchain was still downloading. After i downloaded it completely, the balance was 0. I read something about private keys, but didn&#39;t have to create something like this in the beginning. So i just downloaded the wallet and the blockchain and sent coins to the receiving address. Can you help me finding my coins?
Thanks in advance!</description>

    Have no fear, this is exactly what the Dynamic Peg is design to do. 
The core function of this system is to split BitBay’s total supply into two (2) different tradeable assets: 
Spendable (BAY) and Reserve (BAYR). 
The ratio between these two assets is constantly in flux, due to voting of stakers on the BitBay blockchain. 
When the voting consensus is “deflate”, the total supply of Liquid BAY decreases and the total supply of Reserve BAYR increases. 
When the voting consensus “inflate” the suppl…

<p>If the coins show up here, then you still have them and it’s simply an issue of updating your wallet.</p>
