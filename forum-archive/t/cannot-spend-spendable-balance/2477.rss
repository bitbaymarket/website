My system has the following specifications

QT Wallet, Client Wallet (and version) or Web wallet:3.0.2
Operating System and version: Windows 10
desktop wallet (Qt or Client) block # 2632717 and #43 connections:

The problem I am having is … I cannot send ‘spendable’ balance to LA Token. If I even try to send half of it, I get a error message about oversized transaction (Error: transaction creation failed, CT-7 oversize standard tx size).

Transfer spendable funds is already selected with Inputs: automatically selected.

The fee is already 0.02 but I have tried to increase it to 0.2 and then 1 BAY without success. The same error message appears.

Please help.</description>
