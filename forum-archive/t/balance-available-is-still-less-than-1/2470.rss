    <title>Balance available is still less than 1%</title>

    <description>Hi Guys,

Just a bit worried that there is something wrong with my wallet. I understand the new system but thought I would have a larger percentage available. My wallet is fully synchronised and on the correct chain and I am running the market wallet. Out 0f 83000 coins I can only spend 11, is this right? How long until I will be able to spend more?

Thanks for your continued efforts.
