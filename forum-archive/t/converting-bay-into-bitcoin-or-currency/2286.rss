    <description>Hi Guys, 

I understand using the bitbay software to trade. However are we able to trade bay into USD or bitcoin? Im assuming eventually  there is a way to convert some BAY to cash or BTC if needed?</description>

              <p>Yes the Client has a decentralized marketplace. And we are busy working to update the web wallet which will allow us to turn the “web marketplace” back online.<br>

<p>The Client’s marketplace is currently not very active at the moment.</p>
<p>Until then, the best option to trade fast will be to use LATOKEN exchange.<br>
As we build up awareness with the power of the dynamic peg protocol, we hope that our decentralized marketplaces will come alive with activity especially for OTC deals.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question</p>
