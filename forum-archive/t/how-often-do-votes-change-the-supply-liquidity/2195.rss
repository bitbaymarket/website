    <description>**How often do votes change the supply liquidity?**

As of now, the consensus intervals are at an even 200 blocks, starting at “0”. As each block is approximately 64 seconds, this interval occurs roughly every 3.5 hours… or about 7 voting sessions per day. 

_***Note: The supply can move anywhere between 1-3%, per voting session, depending on the weight of the votes._
