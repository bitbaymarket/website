    <link>..../forum-archive/t/how-to-resync-update-bitbay-wallets-without-losing-your-wallet-and-funds/999</link>
    <description>This was originally written for the hard fork on  on 30th November 2017 that required everyone to update their client but the instructions should work for any wallet update/new fork.

If you have not started the client lately or if you have but did not update it to latest version you might not see correct balance or even get 0 Balance on your client
 
The following procedure will usually remedy the hard fork problem and many more problems with non correctly reported FUNDS inside your wallet.

# FOR MARKET CLIENT 

### 1. find your private keys
You have to have the **2 private keys** that you saved when you first created the account.  If you don&#39;t have 2 keys try  `file &gt; backup wallet` on a regular account and it will ask you to save the 2 keys in a safe place 

### 2. Reinstall the Client 
- erase all the contents on the bitbay data folder except `wallet.dat`
-- Windows default location `c:\bitbay\bitbaydata` folder 
-- MAC default location `Applications &gt; BitBay (right click) &gt; Show package contents &gt; Drive C &gt; BitBay &gt; bitbaydata`
- download the client from the [downloads section](https://bitbay.market/downloads) 
- unzip and run it 
- it should start syncing it might take from a few hours to 1-2 days to sync
- go to `File &gt; open wallet` and follow the instructions (you will need the 2 keys found on previous step)


# FOR QT WALLET
### 1. Find your *bitbay data folder* 
places where you usually find the bitbay data
- Windows QT client `c:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\appdata\roaming\bitbay`
- Linux QT client `~/.bitbay` 
- MAC QT client `~/Library/Application Support/BitBay`

Make sure this folder contains a file named `wallet.dat` which is the most important file on the QT wallet

If you can&#39;t find/see the folders/files mentioned above perhaps you should turn the option on to see hidden files (more details on the NOTES sections)

### 2. Backup your *bitbay data folder* found above
- shutdown the client
- backup/copy the *bitbay data folder* into a different disk or flash drive 
- this backup can be used to restore your BAY in case something goes wrong
so *don&#39;t modify this backup* until you make sure your wallet is working properly

**NOTE:** `wallet.dat` is the most important file in this folder as it contains all **YOUR WALLET** information if you lose this you might lose your funds.  You can also use it to recover from hardware failures or client not starting or moving to a new system. **Remember**  If you have password protected your wallet the `wallet.dat` file is not enough to recover your funds, you have to remember your password as well. 


### 3. Reinstall the Client 
- erase all the contents on the bitbay data folder except `wallet.dat`
- download the client from the [downloads section](https://bitbay.market/downloads) 
- unzip and run it 
- it should start synching it might take from a few hours to 1-2 days to synch



### Need help ?
If you want help please post a new topic in the support section with the issue and the steps you followed

# NOTES 

###  Speed up the synching process 
For windows you can speed up the synching process by downloading one of the following
- blockchain zip from the [downloads section](https://bitbay.market/downloads) which brings you a few weeks behind being fully synced
- newer zip by a trusted member [here](https://mega.nz/#!8k8mjIbR!Y8o6lqbTalibOY3pdX8IiFiNW5-qURmKoYbbKe-6wnc)  which brings you to about one week behind being fully synced

Then
- shutdown the client 
- drop the contents of the zip in the bitbay data folder
- restart the client 
- you will be closer to be fully synced 


### Hidden files
If you can&#39;t find the files/folders mentioned above perhaps you should turn on viewing of hidden files on your system 

On **WINDOWS** you need to turn “view hidden files” or else you will not find `c:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\appdata\roaming\bitbay` 

On **MAC**, you can just visit  `~/Library` from Finder, simply hit `shift + ⌘ (command) + G` which will GO to a folder, then paste in this location:</description>

    The Client wallet already has a bitbay.conf file that can be found in your BitBay directory inside the bitbaydata folder 
Default bitbay data folder locations 
windows client C:\BitBay\bitbaydata 
windows QT client c:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\appdata\roaming\bitbay 
linux QT client ~/.bitbay 
mac QT client ~/Library/Application Support/BitBay 
If you are still having trouble connecting to the network with the Client, then you can update the addnode list from the block explorer.
