•	Combine paid search and organic search data when available to reduce costs while maximizing key business activities
•	Ability to review existing site content, structure and technology and provide optimization recommendations.

•	Develop a framework and reports to systematically track and improve search performance 
•	Stay up-to-date with changes in how search engines measure authority

Requirements:
•	Solid SEO experience– ideally with multiple websites.
•	Demonstrated achievements in systematically improving search rankings that translated into traffic growth and improved site conversion.
