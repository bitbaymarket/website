    <title>Why are my wallet balances always changing?</title>

    <description>Have no fear, this is exactly what the Dynamic Peg is design to do.

The core function of this system is to split BitBay&#39;s total supply into two (2) different tradeable assets: 

**Spendable (BAY)** and **Reserve (BAYR)**.  

The ratio between these two assets is constantly in flux, due to voting of stakers on the BitBay blockchain. 

When the voting consensus is **&quot;deflate&quot;**, the total supply of **Liquid BAY _decreases_** and the total supply of **Reserve BAYR _increases_**. 

When the voting consensus **&quot;inflate&quot;** the supply of **Liquid BAY _increases_** and the total supply of **BAYR _decreases_**.

This is the core concept of how the Dynamic Peg works. As the ratio of the total changes, it is reflected in each and every user&#39;s wallet.
