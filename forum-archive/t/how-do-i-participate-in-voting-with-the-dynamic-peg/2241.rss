    <description>Since each vote is attached to a stake reward, any user who wishes to vote must run a full BitBay node. 

To run a node, the latest version of either the **[BitBay Markets Client or QT wallet must be installed](https://bitbay.market/downloads/)** and synced prior to voting. 

Once your wallet is installed, you can vote by going to the &quot;staking tab&quot; in both the Markets Client and Qt Wallet. There you will be able to select your vote preference:

### Automatic: 
Votes for an algorithm which automatically adjusts the **_deflates or inflates the supply liquidity_** to maintain a healthy price.

### Deflation:
Votes for the supply liquidity to **_decrease_**. When the consensus is for deflate, **sell orders for _BAY_ on the exchange will be reduced accordingly**.

### Inflation:
Votes for the supply liquidity to **_increase_**. When the consensus is for inflate, **sell orders for _BAYR_ on the exchange will be reduced accordingly**.

### No changes:
Votes for the supply liquidity to remain constant.

### Disable: 
Disables all voting within a user&#39;s wallet (will receive full stake reward amounts)

**_Please note:_**
As a hard-coded rule in the Markets Client only, voters must remain active with their wallets in order to participate in Dynamic Peg voting. One cannot simply unlock their wallet, set a vote preference, and let it run passively forever. Every voter must manually refresh their vote decision after a designated number of votes.

The timelines for refreshing a vote preference are as follows:

For the **Markets Client**:
* Manual vote (deflate, inflate, no change) = 1000 votes / 4,000 blocks before reset needed
* Algorithm vote = 200 votes / 4,000 blocks before reset needed

For the **QT wallet**, there is no maximum number of votes, a reset will only be needed after 4,000 blocks.
