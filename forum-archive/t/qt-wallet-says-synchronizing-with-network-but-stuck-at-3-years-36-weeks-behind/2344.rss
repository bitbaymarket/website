I also just saw a post about a hard fork. I haven’t gone near my BitBay in nearly two years. Does this mean I’ve lost my Bay?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out for support. It looks like you are running an old version of the QT Wallet, which is likely on the wrong chain. The latest version is <strong>3.0.2b</strong>. Please follow these directions to update your wallet and get back on the correct chain:</p>

Windows users: users/“yourusername”/appdata/roaming/Bitbay folder (make sure you have “show hidden files” selected) 


Mac users: ~/Library &gt; Application Support &gt; BitBay
