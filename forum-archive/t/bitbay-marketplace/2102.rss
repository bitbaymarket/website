    <description>Hello,

How can I actually get to the bitbay marketplace to see items for sale? I have already downloaded the client/wallet/app think, and all it allowed me to do was to post something I wanted to buy or sell. I saw there was a marketplace in the youtube video that looked very much like ebay or amazon but does it really exist? Why not just make it availalble to a web browser? Am I missing something? 

Please advise,

              <p>Hey thanks reaching out!</p>
<p>BitBay does have a web marketplace in beta right now, which is due to be completed after the upcoming Dynamic Peg Release. You can use it today to buy/sell goods, just know that there might be a few bugs that havenâ€™t been worked out yet.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the link to it:</strong><br>
