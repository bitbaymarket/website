    <title>Contract and Wallet problem</title>
    <link>../../../forum-archive/t/contract-and-wallet-problem/2535</link>
    <description>My system has the following specifications 

Operating System and version: Windows 10
If desktop wallet (Qt or Client) block # of your client and # of connections: Windows Desktop Wallet, Halo 2.5

The problem I am having is:

I created a contract for selling BAY. It doesn´t show up in the Contracts tab, it doesn´t show up in Market tab (nowhere).
However in &quot;History&quot; it show that the BAY for my contract are &quot;reserved&quot;.

I want to cancel the contract. How is that possible, when nothing shows up???</description>
