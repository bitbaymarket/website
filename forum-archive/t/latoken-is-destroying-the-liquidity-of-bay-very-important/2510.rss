    <title>LAToken is DESTROYING the liquidity of BAY (VERY IMPORTANT!)</title>
    <link>../../../forum-archive/t/latoken-is-destroying-the-liquidity-of-bay-very-important/2510</link>
    <description>When my liquid BAY is being sent to LAToken it is either immediately converted back into BAYR (poof and its gone) or is converted into BAYR as soon as it is transferred from Wallet to Spot. The BAY team needs to communicate to them that the BAY deposits need to be segregated so that there is sufficient liquidity in the BAY market, otherwise BAY is likely to be delisted from our only exchange listing!</description>
