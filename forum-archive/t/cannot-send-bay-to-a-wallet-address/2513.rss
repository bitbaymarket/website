    <title>Cannot send BAY to a wallet address</title>
    <link>..../forum-archive/t/cannot-send-bay-to-a-wallet-address/2513</link>
    <description>I&#39;m writing on behalf of a friend who doesn&#39;t speak English well.
He tells me that he cannot &#39;withdraw&#39; (send) BAY to another wallet address. He said that his BAY holding is frozen.

Can you please help me understand what this problem might be and how it can be rectified as he is in desperate need.</description>
