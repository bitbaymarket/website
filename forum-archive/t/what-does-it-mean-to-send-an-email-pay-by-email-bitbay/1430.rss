              <p>If you are talking about pay to mail, using the BitBay Client’s feature, It sends to someone a BAY payment encrypted in an image thanks to steganography by using your mail service. Then the person you sent it to loads it in his BitBay Client and receive the funds instantaneously, hence permitting to send BAY without needing to know the other party’s blockchain address.</p>
