    <description># **What is the voting algorithm, and how does it work?**

The voting algorithm is the easiest way to participate in the Dynamic Peg’s voting/consensus. It will vote for a healthy price based on current market conditions, without the user having to vote manually.

### **_Note: This algorithm is one of several voting options. It will ONLY have an effect on the supply/price if the majority of users choose to select it as a voting option. The algorithm&#39;s initial target price 1/100,000 of Bitcoin&#39;s All Time High (0.20) solely exists to activate its functions, and is NOT a fixed or guaranteed price target._**

# Below is a visual example of how the Dynamic Peg algorithm works:

![Dynamic%20Peg%20Algo|690x271](upload://u5HyeecRZ9ad5AB9DSOgePR89GB.gif)

* The algorithm&#39;s initial target starting rate is .20 (1/100,000 of BTC&#39;s all time high)

* If the price moves beyond a 5% margin above or below the target rate, it will vote for inflation or deflation accordingly. 

* If the price (of either BAY or BTC) moves up to 3x the previous floor (i.e. .60) and remains there for 3 consecutive days, the target will increase by 1.5 times to adapt. 

* Switching back to manual voting is as simple as the click of a mouse. Without an algorithmic oracle, manipulators will incur extreme risk trying to manipulate price in their favor for any significant length of time.

* With this unique voting system, BitBay can change algorithms to test new ideas without requiring a hard fork. Hypothetically, once enough data has been collected and a series of reputable algorithms are found, the human element could be removed entirely. Users can also design their own custom voting algorithms for personal use.


*** **COMING SOON:** BitBay’s custom algorithm option! Users will soon be able to cast votes based on their favorite TA indicator.
