    <title>Cannot send &#39;SPENDABLE&#39; balance (NOT RESOLVED since June 5th)</title>
    <link>..../forum-archive/t/cannot-send-spendable-balance-not-resolved-since-june-5th/2463</link>
    <description>My system has the following specifications 

QT Wallet, Client Wallet (and version) or Web wallet:3.0.2
Operating System and version: Windows 10
desktop wallet (Qt or Client) block # 2632717 and #43 connections: 

The problem I am having is .... I cannot send &#39;spendable&#39;  balance to LA Token. If I even try to send half of it, I get a  error message about oversized transaction (Error: transaction creation failed, CT-7 oversize standard tx size).

Transfer spendable funds is already selected with Inputs:  automatically selected.

Please help.</description>

              <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can you please ensure that the tx fee is .02 BAY or higher? Let me know if it still gives you the error with that fee amount.</p>
