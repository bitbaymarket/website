    <title>GUI Revamp Brainstorming Thread</title>
    <link>../../../forum-archive/t/gui-revamp-brainstorming-thread/1153</link>
    <description> With the upcoming GUI revamp, it&#39;s time to ask ourselves important questions. What sort of improvements will make the BitBay market as usable as possible for the average Joe? What sort of workflow will be most easily adjusted to when switching from other markets such as Amazon or eBay? Are there any features that are redundant or can be removed from the client to make things more simple? What additional features can be implemented, and how would they be added to the current user interface? etc.

If you have not yet tried using the BitBay Market Client, please give it a whirl and get back to us! I will be posting my own views on this topic shortly.</description>
