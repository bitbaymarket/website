    <description>### Why are my deposits and withdrawals taking so long with LA Token? 

To ensure accurate liquidity calculations, LA Token only completes deposits within a 20 block time buffer before each peg index interval, and will show as &quot;pending&quot; until this buffer is reached.

Withdrawals are sent approximately within the _first 10 blocks after the start of a new interval_, and also will show as &quot;pending&quot; until this buffer is reached.

**The Dynamic Peg index interval occurs every 200 blocks.**

## Examples:
### Deposits
If a user initiates a deposit, and it is mined within the buffer zone (i.e. between block #180 and block #200), the transaction will register with LA Token immediately.

However, if a user initiates a deposit, **and it is mined after the buffer zone (block #201)**, they will have to **wait 179 more blocks (until the beginning of the next buffer zone - block #380)** for the transaction to be registered with LA Token.

**Withdrawals can be initiated and mined at any time; however, LA Token sends all withdrawals at the beginning (approx within the first 10 blocks) of each peg interval** 

**_NOTE:_** This above deposit timeframe is subject to be change, once it has seen more testing in a live trading environment, and user feedback has been collected.</description>
