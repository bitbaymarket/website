              <p>BitBay was only listed on LaToken exchange, they found some glitch and are trying to fix it and until then BitBay is not listed anywhere so trading is not possible atm, coinmarketcap gets its data from exchanges that is why no charts, but that should not spike fear because i think after this updates, other exchanges will start listing the token again.</p>
