              <p>Korean Community Manager  x 2?</p>
<p>We are still on the hunt for a Korean Community Manager  who can spare 15-20 hours a week. It’s  a big task this one involving managing and growing a very active community and answering lots of questions.  Of course we will also need posts translated and content updated.  So, we could look to hire a team of 2 for this. Anyone interested, please send your cv to aletha@bitbay.market</p>

<p>German wasn’t on the list but someone has already done some German translations for us of the Bitcointalk OP so perhaps it’s worth looking at Community Management too. Do you have a CV you could share with me or a Linkedin profile? Please send it to aletha@bitbay.market</p>

              <p>Hello. BitBays mail was well received.</p>
<p>If you are selected as a foreign community manager in Korea, you can build a community through forums, KakaoTalk, blogs and cafes.</p>
<p>We will also translate and publish weekly and announcements about BitBay.</p>
<p>We will post BitBay to BitBay’s possibilities to all members who join our community as well as 2000 members.</p>
<p>I currently have an influential kakao talk room and blog in the block chain in Korea. I will build an influential community site in Korea based on such influence.</p>

<p>blog link : <a href="https://blog.naver.com/ykedies" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blog.naver.com/ykedies</a></p>
<p>My idea of ​​BitBay is a next-generation market platform,</p>
<p>a great platform to shake up traditional industries like old eBay and Amazon</p>
<p>So I want to tell people about BitBay.</p>
<p>I would also like to let you know about the BitBay market, a good and convenient platform.</p>
<p>This is my view of BitBay.</p>
<p>I am trying to translate and promote information from BitBay for 3 hours every day and improve the difference between Korean and other languages ​​on this great platform.</p>
<p>So I want to be recognized as my value.</p>
<p>This is what I will try for BitBay.</p>

<p>I do however have a limited understanding of technology although I have a basic level of understanding of the blockchain - translation wise, however, this shouldn’t be a problem, as long as I am not to provide my own technical insights in the texts I would have to write in Dutch - which will not be the case if they are to be literal translations.</p>

<p>I’m based in France. My social media target is an other forum of the french community, so there is people from Canada,Belgium,Switzerland,France mostly.</p>
<p>Maybe it can be difficult to find 2000 french-speaking members but we could try.</p>

</aside>
<p>What does “joining the community” really mean?Like having an account on the forum or using the Bitbay client?</p>
<p>For the translation program, do you have to know something more than translating? I mean, do you have to know a little of coding for translating the website?</p>

              <p>Hi there  so we thought  about French but france itself doesn’t  have a lot ig interest in bitcoin yet so we are not sure if our targets for  community manager can be  met unless you were able  to  target other french speaking nations in your  social media and on our bitbay forum  or  telegram</p>
<p>which country are you based in?</p>
<p>here’s  our  foreign community manager target:</p>
<p>Foreign community manager reward schedule</p>
<p>All foreign community managers are expected to build a community in our own forum + minimum 1 social media.<br>
Translation and posting of weekly and monthly newsletter + any other announcements are mandatory<br>
Translating our site is a separate but mandatory part of the job and is rewarded with 200 $, and is expected to be done within 30 days<br>
Making subtitles for our tutorials is a separate but mandatory part of the job that is rewarded with 200 $, and is expected to be done within 60 days<br>
Improving the translation in our wallet is separate but mandatory and is rewarded with 100$, and is expected to be done within 90 days</p>
<p>Community managers are rewarded with 10 Bay for each member that joins the community up till 2000 members. If 2000 members are not reached within xxx (to be negotiated) days or progress suggests it is not realistic to reach it within that timeframe, community manager will be replaced. After 2000 members are reached community manager is rewarded a maintenance reward of 3000 Bay a month + 10 Bay  for each new member. If there is a month without growth or there is a decrease, they will not get the maintainance reward. If there are 3 months in a 6 month period without growth, community manager will be replaced.<br>
The reward will be adjusted in accordance to price change for Bay</p>

              <p>Hello, If you haven’t found it yet, i would want to become a French Community Manager of BitBay.<br>
I’m on BitBAY since March 2017 and I know a lot about the coin story, the growth and its future!</p>
<p>Also, I know where the crypto french community talk about coins with potential and I could do some advertisment for Bitbay in good topics !</p>
<p>I’m not able to reach the slack after the quick form! <img src="../../../forum-archive/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Thanks you for your answer !</p>
