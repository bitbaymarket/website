              <p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>
<p>BitBay Website Restructure and Relaunch</p>
<hr>
<p>We have had the same website and content for a few years now, with only some small changes made in that time. We need a new website that highlights clearly and effectively all the parts of the BitBay eco-system and is up to date with where the project is at right now.</p>
<p>I would like to build a new site that is based on the current graphics and colours etc, but with a new structure that makes it easier for people to discover and learn about BitBay and all aspects of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Responsible Person:</strong> Shorn</p>
<p><strong>Project Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Research and Analysis - <em>already completed</em>
</li>
<li>Wire-frame - desktop and mobile home page structure, 1 inner content page and site navigation - <em>already completed</em>
</li>
<li>Create new sitemap - <em>already completed</em>
</li>
<li>Community feedback - <em>already completed</em>
</li>
<li>New Website Style guide - <em>in progress</em>
</li>
<li>One page Prototype (Home) - <em>already completed</em>
</li>
<li>Prototype HTML build - <em>in progress</em>
</li>
<li>Device testing</li>
<li>Community feedback</li>
<li>Optimisations</li>
<li>Export static code to host on GitHub pages</li>
<li>Any other tasks as needed (Mailchimp, Google Analytics or Open Web Analytics plus any other integrations)</li>
</ol>
<p>NB. This proposal <em>does not include translation work</em> which will be done by freelance translators where needed. We already have a lot of content prepared so that will be used where possible.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Project Costs:</strong></p>
<p>The total hours spent so far are approx 26. Remaining hours for tasks 7 - 12 = approx 2 weeks full-time (60 hours) at an hourly rate of €35.</p>
<p><strong>Total budget required to complete the tasks above: €2100</strong></p>
<p>Once 50% of the total amount has been received (approx €1050 depending on btc value) I will continue working on the tasks above. <em>Any donations over the amount will go towards future tasks.</em></p>

<p><strong>Payment addresses:</strong></p>
<p>BTC: 3LShcwRJsNdtKMR1sgRf7Ah36T3mKnZsj4</p>
<p>USDT: 0x9050C8c69E6F1Fe5cEF50B28B3EBcbBe0D7e45f8</p>

<p>Many thanks for reading and all donations are welcome no matter how small <img src="../../forum-archive/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>All our forum members are invited to submit their ideas and suggestions to:</p>
<ul>
<li>help enhance the BitBay ecosystem</li>
<li>increase adoption of BAY as a stable currency</li>
<li>build real-world products and solutions</li>
<li>contribute to the BitBay source code</li>
</ul>
<p>The community will be able to vote on every proposal that is submitted via this forum category.</p>
<p>We are also excited to announce the Community Projects Initiative will have its own dedicated fund enabling the community to reward the projects with a total of <strong>250,000 BAY</strong> available over the 12 month period from <strong>January - December 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>Contributions that gain enough votes will be advanced to a second round where they are rated by the community and core team based on factors such as the concept, code quality, ease-of-use, adoption process etc. We’ll have more details about this rating process before we launch the dedicated '<strong>BitBay Community Website</strong>’ in December.</p>
<p><strong><em>Voting will be added to this category soon</em></strong></p>
