              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>How can I actually get to the bitbay marketplace to see items for sale? I have already downloaded the client/wallet/app think, and all it allowed me to do was to post something I wanted to buy or sell. I saw there was a marketplace in the youtube video that looked very much like ebay or amazon but does it really exist? Why not just make it availalble to a web browser? Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Please advise,<br>

          <title>Does BitBay has something similar as the Horizon API of the Stellar platform? Can I create my own web market front end?</title>

              <p>Hi! Completely new here and I just found the project while trying to figure out how to do something.</p>
<p>Stellar is another crypto that has developed a <a href="https://github.com/stellar/horizon" rel="nofollow noopener">server API called Horizon</a> that anyone can host and allows people to communicate with the blockchain through web requests. This is very useful, since then you don’t need to build the market yourself, but anyone can create their own SPA market application by using the API.</p>
<p>Here is what I want to do: I want to create an online market to support my local community, people in the community decide which institutions/organizations they want to fund, and everyone agrees to pay a % of every purchase they make, or every profits they make, to the institutions they agreed to support.</p>
<p>Everyone on the community and the institutions should have a public address, and in a companion platform (for organization and democratic discussions) they can hold each other accountable to how much they contribute.</p>
<p>If the market is accessible through an API in the same way that Stellar offers Horizon, anyone can create their own niche market without the need of a server, in the same way one could create a Shopify store.</p>
<p>What I want to do is create a community-approved market where people participating agree that every time they buy something or they receive profits, a certain voluntary tax is paid and sent to the institutions that the community is funding.</p>

              <p>As we know ,bitbay release a new feature called dynamic peg,which make bitbay a stable coin.what i read about the dynamic peg from the white paper tell me this feature is used for anti inflation or deflation.And this function is realized by coin liquidity controlling.This concept is quite like the modern finance. Central bank will control the fiat money stability by increase or decrease the reserve ratio to afford or release liquidity. But this method has definitily some hysteresis.The purpose of freezing or releasing might take place usually long time after the action,maybe several monthes or years.<br>
The developping purpose of bitbay is to afford a kind of exhanging insurance  which would make the goods exchange trustfull based on the smart contracts.In this contract ,both dealers deposit certain amounts of bays to this contract, if the deal is not finished ,none of them will cancel the contract ,so the bays of each owner will reamin in the contract instead of return to the owner. I think this is a quite good mechanism to build a decentralized trustfull market  without an escrow.<br>
But in the actual deal ,i can image a picture that if both dealer sign a smart contract and deposit some bays to this contract.Meanwhile ,the bay’s price get a drastic drop by USD.In this case ,if the buyer send the money to the seller ,the seller would not send goods to the buyer ,Or if the seller send goods to the buyer ,the buyer would reject paying money to the seller.As both dealers will not care the bays in the contract as its worthless calculated by USD maybe.<br>
So ,how to solve this flaw in this imaged case?</p>

              <p>Based on the overview of the Dynamic Peg on the main site, the logic behind it makes a lot of sense. Having said that, have a few questions on how this works in reality.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How will one know the timing and magnitude of their coins that have been frozen or released?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s mentioned that the freezing of coins is based on when you sent / received coins, how does this work? It would seem that this would be agnostic to timing of sending / receiving coins and simply based on total coins in your possession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do reserve / frozen coins have value? Using the example from the overview, if you have 200 coins at $1 and coin deflates 50% (freeze half) to drive price to $2 and you now have 100 liquid coins at $2 (same $200 total value), how is there any value in your 100 reserve coins? Seems like its a zero sum game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From investment perspective, once the peg is rolled out how will the value appreciate if supply is flexed to control changes fluctuations in price?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apologies if this is redundant and has been covered in more detail elsewhere.</p>
<p>Big supporter of what you guys are building here!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Completely new to BAY (and the entire crypto world for that matter).</p>
<p>For High Sierra users with issues installing the client, currently is the only alternative way of buying BAY by going through an exchange? If so, would I first need to buy bitcoin then exchange for BAY? Then simply create a web wallet and transfer BAY from the exchange to the wallet?</p>
<p>Any timing update / estimate on a revised client that is compatible with High Sierra?</p>
