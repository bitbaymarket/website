              <p>When my liquid BAY is being sent to LAToken it is either immediately converted back into BAYR (poof and its gone) or is converted into BAYR as soon as it is transferred from Wallet to Spot.</p>
<p>Anyone buying BAY to trade on LAToken will instantly look 99.8% of value - killing liquidity and destroying the reputation of BAY as a tradeable asset.</p>
<p>The BAY team needs to communicate to them that the BAY deposits need to be segregated so that there is sufficient liquidity in the BAY market, otherwise BAY is likely to be delisted from our one and only exchange listing!</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I downloaded the bitbay qt wallet in the beginning of the year and transferred some BAY to the receiving address that is shown. I was in a hurry, because the exchange, where i bought the coins, said i had to move those, otherwise they would get lost. So i didn’t waste time and sent the coins to the qt wallet, while the blockchain was still downloading. After i downloaded it completely, the balance was 0. I read something about private keys, but didn’t have to create something like this in the beginning. So i just downloaded the wallet and the blockchain and sent coins to the receiving address. Can you help me finding my coins?<br>
Thanks in advance!</p>
