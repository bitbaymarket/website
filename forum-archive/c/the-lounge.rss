              <p>Hey, i´m in this coin, i believe in the idea and in the project so far, i cant wait to sell and buy anything here, but i think there are some still important points to do now, points wich are also not that difficult to do , and i want u to ask for this 2 Points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>More Exchanges, Binance, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Kraken, Okx, etc., its simply a mainfactor for a good coin to be listed on a few markets, this project here is good, but way to low exchanges, most of the younger coins are listed at twice as many exchanges as bitbay. CCEX has marked Bitbay for delisting… wich is a result of no marketing for a great product - no refresh in the people minds/market mind, ok u can say now the product is the important thing, a working product sells it self, i would completly agree with this BUT not with 4-5 Exchanges, if this coin is listed on 10-12 Exchanges and most of the big Exchanges are in, i even would not have started this thread here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More Marketing, i heard also about “hire a korean marketer” but in my opinion not only Asia/Korea, this coin needs a Marketing Campaign, u have to pay for marketing with connection wich gives u real marketing impact, so bitbay dont needs another marketer, it needs a connection, or a marketer with connection or maybe even a partner but im not sure if a partner is matching in this project, just good marketing will be enough, its a good product it has something to sell, not only another Coin, it is also a Marketplace, and not just a marketplace like ebay, it is a decentral blockchain based marketplace with no fees where u can buy and sell anonym, lol it simply needs no big show, it stands for itself, u only have to tell it, but u dont tell it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many Coins will be glad if they had a product wich needs no big show for marketing like Bitbay, just do it.</p>
<p>This 2 Points results in the same problem: to less investments and to less members for the bitbay marketplace. Listing a coin at to less exchanges + no active innovative (justintime) marketing= very bad for a coin wich wants members, buyers and sellers for his Marketplace too.</p>
<p>If i could decide, for the beginning i would look for good Youtubers for a interview etc., and synchronized push my own Youtubechannel of Bitbay also with this interviews and make frequently good Videos on my own bitbay channel… There are many serious Youtuber for Kryptos, decide one in every language, i can tell u one for the German Room: “Bitcoin Informant”.</p>
<p>i can only repeat it: A Marketplace with no fees, also anonym, decentral - dont needs much lalalala it only needs to be shown/said, that makes it quite simple for marketing. Bitbay has more History than other coins, and it needs a refresh in peoples minds, simply a good marketing campaign, only one will be enough, if bitbay is in, than its in and runs by itself, but u have to get it in, now in one act with the “sell and buy anything teamplate”</p>
<p>i hope that i have not to tell u how u can promote this product, there are many ways… like simply a visualized compersion ebay vs bitbay, u sell a 500€ product at ebay = u pay 50€ fees, u seel it at bitbay = fees + u have the same security for buying and selling like ebay with paypal, but STOP for that f. Paypal Service wich stands for the ebay security u also have to pay fees, haha u even can show this in the mainstreammedia, thats the point of bitbay, it has also the potential to build a new bridge from mainstream to crypto.</p>
<p>And sorry for my english Boys and Girls, i dont like this language.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>This week some people have expressed concerns as to how effectively we are marketing the BitBay Market Client. While I can tell you with certainty we are working behind the scenes to make a solid, coordinated effort to spread the word about BAY, in order to get everyone involved we decided to pose this question to the community.</p>
<p>So what would you like to see from BitBay to gain more eyes from investors and early-adopters?</p>
<p>So far, suggestions I have seen personally are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotional Facebook campaigns</li>
<li>Twitter ad campaigns</li>
<li>An introduction video for people who may not necessarily have time to spare reading our website in its entirety</li>
<li>Get BitBay listed on other exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>This being only a few, of course. What do you think BAY should do to spread the word?</p>

              <p>Sorry to post so many questions at once. The “BitBay” name collision made it difficult to google an answer, and also the lack of FAQ section on the frontpage~</p>
<p>So I have a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is BitBay market also fee-less like Open-Bazaar? Or is it like syscoin where even creating an alias requires coins.</li>
<li>Is BitBay open source?</li>
<li>BitBay the cryptocurrency, when transferred from wallet to wallet, does it require transfer fees like Bitcoin? (an example of fee-less is IOTA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>P.S. It would be great if a comparison table is in the frontpage, and a FAQ is available <img src="../../forum-archive/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<a class="mention-group" href="/groups/everyone">@everyone</a> In the near future Bittrex will be implementing significant changes that will not only affect your user accounts but will also affect the ability for programs such as TraderDaddy to work on any scale.<br>
Please read up on this: <a href="https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003004171-What-are-my-trade-limits-">https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003004171-What-are-my-trade-limits-</a><br>
And if you are in the Bittrex Slack then <em>PUT UP A FIGHTING ARUGMENT WHY THEY NO LONGER HAVE USERS/TRADERS IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS</em></p>

This is a great depiction of what’s taking place at the moment.<br>
Venezuela look like it’s trying to fight back against the power elite that try to break them down.<br>

<p>Bitcoin is not a currency. It’s just a super volatile commodity that is virtually impossible to innovate.</p>

              <p>Have been curious about the possibilities of contract assignments with BitBay’s DDE?</p>
<p>For example: a merchant goes into contract with a potential seller, if merchant cannot purchase outright or come to terms with seller, the merchant then assigns that contract to someone in their pool of other contacts/buyers who actually can meet the terms.</p>
<p>I know it’s used mostly in real estate, and maybe some other industries, but never (to my knowledge) been done with smart contracts or for other smaller personal items. How could the deposits be set up in a situation like this?</p>
