The BAY team needs to communicate to them that the BAY deposits need to be segregated so that there is sufficient liquidity in the BAY market, otherwise BAY is likely to be delisted from our only exchange listing!</p>

<p>My full balance is showing in “actual balance” but the wallet won’t allow me to send it. My “Available balance” shows just 0.6 BAY while my “Actual balance” is showing many 1000s of time more than that. When I try to send just 10 BAY it says “Not enough available funds”. How do I access my “Actual Balance” please? Thank you!</p>

              <p>The experience I have with BAY is frustration and annoyance. Our money is locked in the BAYR format and waiting for the community to vote to inflate is futile given the time it takes to actually transfer all of your BAYR into BAY.</p>
<p>I know this may seem a little redundant but I am trying to grasp the reality of what is happening with BAY right now. The PEG system is a lovely idea and the price of BAY has gone up in a wonderful way, yet I am unable to sell anything and be rewarded for holding BAY. I think the PEG system only works with millions of active people voting, not the current state of BAY.</p>
<p>I bought into BAY as an idea at the beginning and hold more than enough currently. I stopped following the project for a while and when I came back found the PEG system and have been trying to wrap my head around the realities of it - which seem to be different than the thesis of it.<br>
When I came back I found some hurdles to overcome with the RESERVE SYSTEM (BAYR) and sending/receiving it. Tried to sell some coins on the only market open to BAY and that was totally useless given my coins were almost worthless in the BAYR format. Used my coins to vote with the QT wallet for inflation and found that almost nothing changed and they still remained as BAYR.</p>
<p>I don’t see the inflation calculations working to be honest. Having a very tiny fraction of my coins change from BAYR to BAY is not helpful in any way. Then watching them change back a day later is frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>My question seems simple but from my experience so far it isn’t in practice:</strong> How do I actually sell my BAY? All of it, every last coin. I have been here for a long time and want to sell as BAY - not BAYR.</p>
<p>If the answer is you can’t, or that you have to sell in tiny fractions and wait for someone else to vote with you, then I want out. Totally out of this project because a system with no viable exit is a tyrannical system.</p>

              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Just a bit worried that there is something wrong with my wallet. I understand the new system but thought I would have a larger percentage available. My wallet is fully synchronised and on the correct chain and I am running the market wallet. Out 0f 83000 coins I can only spend 11, is this right? How long until I will be able to spend more?</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued efforts.</p>

              <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>All I have now from my bitbay wallet is a backup from 30/08/2019 with files : key1.private, key1.share, key2.private, key2.share and ContractsBackup.dat.</p>
<p>I tried to install the new wallet but don’t see any way to recover ?</p>
<p>Is there a way to restore my wallet with that. I tried an importprivkey in the console with the private key I find in Key1.private, but the key is not recognised.</p>

<p>Any way I can recover?<br>
Any help welcome.<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is that I sent 5000 BAY to LATOKEN (B4aZYR1JCHSejgFhPc61JWzfPw1Eq8aKqV) and they have said that the txhash cannot be found in the explorer:</p>

<p>They also asked:</p>
<p>“Are you sure you sent it on the correct side of the chain?<br>
It is not detected on LATOKEN side either.<br>
Could you please check on which block is your transaction, and see with BAY team why this transaction is not visible in the explorer (which is up to date it would seem)?”</p>
<p>Please advise?</p>
